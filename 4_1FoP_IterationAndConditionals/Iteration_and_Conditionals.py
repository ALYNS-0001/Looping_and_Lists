To answer these questions you are not permitted to use a list/dictionary data structure.
You must ensure that all of your implementations match the return type of the function.
You will be working with strings

"""
Question 1
Implement a function, getSumOfString(s:str)->int, so that the function returns an integer
which sums all of the numbers in the string passed as the only argument to the function.

Different integers are signified by a space e.g. '1 2 12 -1' are four separate integers
which would return the int 14

def getSumOfString(s: str) -> int:

    #write your code here

    return 0

"""
Question 2 
Implement a function, reorder(s: str)-> str, which returns a lexicographically ordered
string containing all characters in the string s which is passed as the function's only
argument. Characters in the original string may be any lower or upper case character in 
the alphabet. For identical letters (irrespective of upper/lower case) please order them
according to which appears first in the string s.

e.g reorder("vAta") -> "Aatv"
    reorder("CbzB") -> "bBCz"
"""

def reorder(s: str) -> str:

    #write your code here

    return "nothing"

"""
Question 3

Implement a function, orderAndDeleteDuplicates(s: str)-> str, which returns a 
lexicographically ordered string where any duplicate letters (regardless of upper 
or lower case) have been removed. For duplicate letters, the letter which appears
first in the string s must be the letter which remains.

e.g.    orderAndDeleteDuplicates("vAta") -> "Atv"
        orderAndDeleteDuplicates("CbzB") -> "bCz"
"""

def orderAndDeleteDuplicates(s: str)-> str:

    # write your code here
